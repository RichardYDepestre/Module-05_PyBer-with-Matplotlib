# PyBer Project Analysis
This is challenge is meant to analyze and summarize ride data for the decision makers at PyBer.
The data compiled and provided to us comes into two datasets:
   1) The first: citi_data.csv lists the number of drivers that services cities located in three areas: Urban, Suburban and Rural;
   2) the second: ride_data.csv is more detailed and offers metrics into the dates the rides took place and the rates charges to customers by cities.
Since the two data sets intersect -via city field- we simply merged them and extrapolated information such as:
   1) total rides by areas;
   2) number of drivers the three (3) areas identified earlier;
   3) the total amount of fares PyBer has collected in these areas.
PyBer derives 60% of its revenues from rides in urban areas banking $39,854. In our view there is potential in the other areas 
if they were to decrease their fares in the in the Suburban and rural areas. The interest to using PyBer's services does exist in the urban and suburban cities. A campaign targeting these areas with fares that appeal to both drivers and customers could generate revenues.
